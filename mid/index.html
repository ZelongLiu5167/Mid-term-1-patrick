            The Chinese zodiac is an ancient cultural symbol representing twelve animals, with each year corresponding to one of the animals in a twelve-year cycle. 
            
            The most famous story about the zodiac order is the "Zodiac Race." The Jade Emperor organized a race across a river, where the animals competed using their intelligence and abilities, ultimately determining the order of the twelve zodiac signs.</h2>
